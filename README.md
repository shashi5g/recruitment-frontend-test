# Frontend Test

Hi! Welcome to our frontend test which you'll have to complete before being able to join the GoProposal development team.

**Important**: This test should not be made publicly accessible in any way.

## Introduction

This is a fairly basic frontend project to give us a general idea of where you are as a developer.

You should approach this task as you would approach any other piece of work, on a typical day. You should think about the frameworks, tools, libraries and coding practices you might need to use to make your life easier.

We will evaluate the quality, the re-usability and the maintainability of any code produced.

## Project Requirements

You need to build a very simple web application that will be able to list proposals as well as giving the user the ability to create, change status and delete proposals. Your application should have the following functionality:

* Proposals are listed in no specific order.
* New proposals can be created.
* Existing proposals can be marked as won.
* Existing proposals can have status reset from won to live.
* Existing proposals can be deleted.

We have provided a mock API you can run as follows:
```
$ cd api
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```
The API will now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Documentation for the mock API is available in **api/docs**.

We have initialised a barebones React app using create-react-app which you can find in the **app** folder. While we'd prefer you use React, you can replace it and complete this project with the JavaScript framework of your choice.

You can implement the UI in any way you want. Please make sure your solution is maintainable and responsive. 

## Project Extras

It would be nice to see unit or feature testing but this is not a hard requirement.

## Your Notes

Once you're happy with your test, please add in any notes below explaining your approach and implementation.

I have not wriiten unit test and also there is obne bug   form is not getting clear after update and creating the  data
## Submitting Your Test

To submit your test, please:

1. Setup a **private** GitHub repository and push your code.
2. **Don't use** Git submodules.
3. Invite the following GitHub users to review your test:
 * [@ivonunes](https://github.com/ivonunes)
 * [@denmuntjans](https://github.com/denmuntjans)
4. Email a link to your repository to [ivo.vicentenunes@sage.com](mailto:ivo.vicentenunes@sage.com).

Good luck!

Thanks for taking the time to do our test, and we look forward to hear from you.
